## 💬 **Test the Agent - Example Conversations**

### Conversation 1: Basic Booking
```
You: "Hello, I'd like to schedule a meeting"
Agent: "I'd be happy to help you schedule a meeting! Could you please tell me your preferred date?"

You: "Tomorrow afternoon would be great"
Agent: "Great! I found some available time slots for you:
1. 2025-06-26 from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM
2. 2025-06-26 from 01:00 PM to 02:00 PM
3. 2025-06-26 from 03:00 PM to 04:00 PM
Which option works best for you?"

You: "The first option looks good"
Agent: "Perfect! I'll book the slot on 2025-06-26 from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Should I confirm this booking?"

You: "Yes, please confirm the booking"
Agent: "✅ Booking Confirmed! Your meeting has been successfully scheduled..."
```
